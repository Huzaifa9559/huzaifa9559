# Hi, I’m Huzaifa Naseer

I’m a full-stack software engineer and final-year CS student at FAST NUCES (Karachi).  
I build production SaaS products end-to-end (backend, frontend, database, deployment) and I also explore applied AI/ML through research experiments.

## What I do
- Full-stack product development (MVP → production)
- Backend architecture & APIs (NestJS / Node.js, Laravel)
- Frontend engineering (React, state management, reusable UI)
- DevOps basics for real deployments (Docker, CI/CD, AWS/DO)
- Applied AI research projects (PEFT/LoRA experiments on vision models)

## Current focus
- Building scalable SaaS modules with clean architecture + strong DX
- Shipping client work reliably using milestones, documentation, and agile execution
- Research experiments: parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) on ViT-based models

## Tech I use
**Backend:** NestJS, Node.js, Laravel, REST/GraphQL, TypeORM  
**Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Redux / TanStack, Tailwind  
**Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB  
**DevOps:** Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS / DigitalOcean  
**AI/ML (learning + projects):** PyTorch, computer vision, PEFT/LoRA

## Featured work
I keep important repos public where possible so others can learn, use, and contribute.

- **SaaS / Products:**  
  - [Project 1](https://github.com/huzaifa9559/REPO_NAME_1) — one-liner what it does  
  - [Project 2](https://github.com/huzaifa9559/REPO_NAME_2) — one-liner what it does  

- **AI / Research:**  
  - [LoRA / TransReID Experiments](https://github.com/huzaifa9559/REPO_NAME_3) — results + configs + notes  

- **DevOps / Deployment:**  
  - [Dockerized Deployment Setup](https://github.com/huzaifa9559/REPO_NAME_4) — multi-env compose / CI notes  

> Replace `REPO_NAME_*` with your actual repository names.

## Open to
- Freelance / contract work (SaaS, APIs, dashboards, integrations)
- Internships / entry roles (backend / full-stack)
- Collaboration on practical open-source projects
